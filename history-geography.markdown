I want to map out what I know, and things I'd like to learn about in geography and history.

I am starting this out by building a carefully formatted markdown document that I can potentially extract data from, to create an interactive map and timeline.

Software I am using to help is:

 - [markup.rocks](http://markup.rocks) for in-browser conversion
 - [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) for offline conversion
 - [visjs](http://visjs.org) for timelines
